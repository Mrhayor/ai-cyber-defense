This project is an AI-powered cyber defense system designed for real-time detection and prevention of emerging cyber threats. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze network activity, identify anomalies, and proactively defend against attacks such as unauthorized access, phishing attempts, and suspicious behavior.

Key features include:

Real-time Threat Detection – Continuously monitors network traffic and system logs to detect anomalies instantly.

Predictive Analysis – Uses AI to anticipate potential security breaches before they occur.

Automated Response – Responds to threats by alerting administrators, blocking suspicious activity, or initiating predefined security protocols.

Session and Device Monitoring – Tracks user sessions, IP addresses, device fingerprints, and geolocation for improved security insights.

Customizable Alerts – Provides email notifications, dashboard alerts, and optional two-factor authentication triggers for sensitive activities.

This project was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and HBS, this framework is lightweight, extensible, and adaptable for both personal and enterprise cybersecurity applications.
